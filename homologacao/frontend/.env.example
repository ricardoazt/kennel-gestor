# API Backend URL
# 
# For Docker setup: use http://localhost:3001 (Docker maps container port 3000 to host port 3001)
# For local development without Docker: use http://localhost:3000
# For development with custom IP/domain: adjust accordingly
#
# IMPORTANT: This should match how you access the backend from your browser
# If backend is running in Docker, it's usually http://localhost:3001
# If backend is running locally (npm start), it's usually http://localhost:3000
